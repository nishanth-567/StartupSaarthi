        <div class="question">Q: What is the difference between a Private Limited Company and an LLP?</div>
        <div class="answer">A: A Private Limited Company (Pvt Ltd) is a separate legal entity with limited liability for shareholders, requiring minimum 2 directors and 2 shareholders. It's ideal for startups seeking VC funding as investors prefer equity investments. An LLP (Limited Liability Partnership) combines partnership flexibility with limited liability, requiring minimum 2 partners. LLPs have fewer compliance requirements and lower costs but may face challenges in raising VC funding since investors cannot hold equity shares. Pvt Ltd is preferred for scalable startups planning to raise funding, while LLP suits professional services firms and consultancies.</div>

        <div class="question">Q: What is the difference between equity and debt financing?</div>
        <div class="answer">A: Equity Financing: You raise capital by selling ownership shares (equity) in your company to investors. Investors become shareholders and may get voting rights. You don't have to repay the money, but you dilute your ownership. Best for high-growth startups that need capital without repayment pressure. Debt Financing: You borrow money that must be repaid with interest, without giving up equity. You retain full ownership and control, but have repayment obligations regardless of business performance. Best for established startups with predictable cash flows. Many startups use a mix of both.</div>
