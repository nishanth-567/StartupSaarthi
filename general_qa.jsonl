{"id": "general_qa_0001", "intent": "GENERAL", "question": "What is the difference between a Private Limited Company and an LLP?", "answer": "A Private Limited Company (Pvt Ltd) is a separate legal entity with limited liability for shareholders, requiring minimum 2 directors and 2 shareholders. It's ideal for startups seeking VC funding as investors prefer equity investments. An LLP (Limited Liability Partnership) combines partnership flexibility with limited liability, requiring minimum 2 partners.
